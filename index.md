## LeftOvers
A recipe app. You input your 3 main ingredients- a protein, vegetable and carb. Then you select which meal you want a recipe for. The app then takes those inputs and creates a list of recipes that include those ingredients. Additionally, it queries another API and uses an algorithm to pair a beer with the listed recipes.

## Bloccit
A clone of reddit built with Ruby on Rails.  You can create accounts, topics, and submit links to topics that are then up- or down-voted by members and sorted by an algorithm just like Reddit.  You can even create private topics only approved members can participate in and view.

## Shorten-my-URL-Please
A simple URL shortening app builtin Ruby on Rails.  You provide a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL and it will generate a valid shortened form of the URL for you to use.

## Parcel App
App that won the [Hacktoberfest](http://hacktoberfe.st/) code challenge sponsored by Camden Living Apartments. Built in Backbone, it takes a form that simulates data captured by the bar-code scan of a received package. It then sends an SMS to the phone number provided in the form (the phone number must be of the format "1xxxxxxxxxx"). The recipient can then reply "yes" to the request for home delivery. At that point, the database is updated with the delivery choice selection. When the package is delivered, it can be removed from the dashboard by clicking the checkbox.

## Front-End Engineer job board
A curated job board tailored just for front-end JavaScript developers. It's a full-responsive single-page app built in Backbone.JS with Stripe integration. To post a job, companies have to create an account. When they fill out the form to post a job, the app requires a payment of $20 with the Stripe API.  Once the payment is approved, the job is posted to the main listings page. Jobs are posted for 30 days before expiring. Accounts can track jobs that they posted, including expired jobs.  Currently, Stripe is in the test environment so you can test payments with a test card number of "4242 4242 4242 4242" to test the functionality. There is also a feature to sort jobs by type on the job listings page.
